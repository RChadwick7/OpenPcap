Windows standalone 64bit Executable program, Open-Pcap.exe, is in dist folder.
You can move it to Desktop for example and execute without any dependency.
It is developed with Python/Tkinter and src is OpenPcapGUI.py in this folder.

Below is how to use this program with OPi-PCap device.

1. Plug Open-Pcap dongle in USB port. It will ask to run driver_installer program
   If it doesn't, go to File Browser > RTL_UL folder and run RTK_NIC_DRIVER_INTALLER.sfx.exe manually
   (For MAC OSX, and Windows, it will automatically come up as USB-Ethernet adapter)

2. Network Connections show Open-Pcap is configured as Realtek USB network adapter

3. Start OPi-Pcap program
   Wait until Status shows "Device Ready"

3. If you don't know target AP's channel, start site Survey.
   It runs for 5s and shows all APs in the area.

4. Now you know target AP's channel, set channel to same as target AP
   When you select channel, Open-PCap automatically configures Channel.

5. Click Start Wireshark
   Once you're done, you can stop Wireshark from Wireshark itself or from OPi-PCap.
   When Wireshark is running, "Start" button becomes "Stop" button.

6. (Optional) You can apply filter(AP MAC address) to reduce capture traffic.
   Without filter, Open-PCap will capture all traffic.

7. Always shutdown OPi-Pcap gracefully to pretect file system.
